            </header>
                <p>
                    Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To print a string in Python 3, just write:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    print('Hello, world!')
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>Indentation</h3>
                <p>
                    Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    x = 1
    if x == 1:
        print('Hello, World!')
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>Variables and Types</h2>
            </header>
                <p>
                    Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.
                </p>

            <h3>Numbers</h3>

                <p>
                    Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To define an integer, use the following syntax:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    myint = 7
    print(myint)
                    </code>
                </pre>       
                
                <p>
                    To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    myfloat = 7.0
    print(myfloat)
    myfloat = float(7)
    print(myfloat)
                    </code>
                </pre>    

            <h3>Strings</h3>
                <p>
                    Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mystring = 'hello'
    print(mystring)
    mystring = "hello"
    print(mystring)
                    </code>
                </pre>   
                
                <p>
                    The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)
                </p>
       
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
    print(mystring)
                    </code>
                </pre>   

                <p>
                    There are additional variations on defining strings that make it easier to include things such as carriage returns, backslashes and Unicode characters. These are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but are covered in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" target="_blank">Python documentation.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    one = 1
    two = 2
    three = one + two
    print(three)
    
    hello = "hello"
    world = "world"
    helloworld = hello + " " + world
    print(helloworld)
                    </code>
                </pre>  
                
                <p>
                    Assignments can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same line like this
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    a, b = 3, 4
    print(a,b)
                    </code>
                </pre>  

                <p>
                    Mixing operators between numbers and strings is not supported:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This will not work!
    one = 1
    two = 2
    hello = "hello"
    
    print(one + two + hell  o)
                    </code>
                </pre>  
        </section>

        <!--3-->
        <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>Lists</h2>
            </header>

                <p>
                    Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mylist = []
    mylist.append(1)
    mylist.append(2)
    mylist.append(3)
    print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
    print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
    print(mylist[2]) # prints 3
    
    # prints out 1,2,3
    for x in mylist:
        print(x)
                    </code>
                </pre>   

                <p>
                    Accessing an index which does not exist generates an exception (an error).
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    print(mylist[10])
                    </code>
                </pre>

            </header>
                <p>
                    This section explains how to use basic operators in Python.
                </p>
            
            <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
               
                <p>
                    Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
    print(number)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Try to predict what the answer will be. Does python follow order of operations?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another operator available is the modulo (%) operator, which returns the integer remainder of the division. dividend % divisor = remainder.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    remainder = 11 % 3
    print(remainder)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    squared = 7 ** 2
    cubed = 2 ** 3
    print(squared)
    print(cubed)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            
            <h3>Using Operators with Strings</h3>

                <p>
                    Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
    print(helloworld)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
    print(lotsofhellos)
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>Using Operators with Lists</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
    odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
    all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
    print(all_numbers)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>
                    Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    print([1,2,3] * 3)
                    </code>
                </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="String_Formatting">
            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>String Formatting</h2>
            </header>

                <p>
                    Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This prints out "Hello, John!"
    name = "John"
    print("Hello, %s!" % name)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    To use two or more argument specifiers, use a tuple (parentheses):
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This prints out "John is 23 years old."
    name = "John"
    age = 23
    print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Any object which is not a string can be formatted using the %s operator as well. The string which returns from the "repr" method of that object is formatted as the string. For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This prints out: A list: [1, 2, 3]
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    print("A list: %s" % mylist)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Here are some basic argument specifiers you should know:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %d - Integers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %f - Floating point numbers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </header>

                <p>
                    Strings are bits of text. They can be defined as anything between quotes:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    astring2 = 'Hello world!'
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    As you can see, the first thing you learned was printing a simple sentence. This sentence was stored by Python as a string. However, instead of immediately printing strings out, we will explore the various things you can do to them. You can also use single quotes to assign a string. However, you will face problems if the value to be assigned itself contains single quotes. For example to assign the string in these bracket(single quotes are ' ') you need to use double quotes only like this
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print("single quotes are ' '")

    print(len(astring))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    That prints out 12, because "Hello world!" is 12 characters long, including punctuation and spaces.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring.index("o"))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    That prints out 4, because the location of the first occurrence of the letter "o" is 4 characters away from the first character. Notice how there are actually two o's in the phrase - this method only recognizes the first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But why didn't it print out 5? Isn't "o" the fifth character in the string? To make things more simple, Python (and most other programming languages) start things at 0 instead of 1. So the index of "o" is 4.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring.count("l"))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    For those of you using silly fonts, that is a lowercase L, not a number one. This counts the number of l's in the string. Therefore, it should print 3.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring[3:7])
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This prints a slice of the string, starting at index 3, and ending at index 6. But why 6 and not 7? Again, most programming languages do this - it makes doing math inside those brackets easier.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you just have one number in the brackets, it will give you the single character at that index. If you leave out the first number but keep the colon, it will give you a slice from the start to the number you left in. If you leave out the second number, it will give you a slice from the first number to the end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You can even put negative numbers inside the brackets. They are an easy way of starting at the end of the string instead of the beginning. This way, -3 means "3rd character from the end".
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring[3:7:2])
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This prints the characters of string from 3 to 7 skipping one character. This is extended slice syntax. The general form is [start:stop:step].
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring[3:7])
    print(astring[3:7:1])
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Note that both of them produce same output
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no function like strrev in C to reverse a string. But with the above mentioned type of slice syntax you can easily reverse a string like this
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring[::-1])
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring.upper())
    print(astring.lower())
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    These make a new string with all letters converted to uppercase and lowercase, respectively.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    print(astring.startswith("Hello"))
    print(astring.endswith("asdfasdfasdf"))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This is used to determine whether the string starts with something or ends with something, respectively. The first one will print True, as the string starts with "Hello". The second one will print False, as the string certainly does not end with "asdfasdfasdf".
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    astring = "Hello world!"
    afewwords = astring.split(" ")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    This splits the string into a bunch of strings grouped together in a list. Since this example splits at a space, the first item in the list will be "Hello", and the second will be "world!".

        <section class="main-section" id="Conditions">
            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>Conditions</h2>
            </header>

                <p>
                    Python uses boolean logic to evaluate conditions. The boolean values True and False are returned when an expression is compared or evaluated. For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    x = 2
    print(x == 2) # prints out True
    print(x == 3) # prints out False
    print(x < 3) # prints out True
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Notice that variable assignment is done using a single equals operator "=", whereas comparison between two variables is done using the double equals operator "==". The "not equals" operator is marked as "!=".
                </p>

            <h3>Boolean Operators</h3>

                <p>
                    The "and" and "or" boolean operators allow building complex boolean expressions, for example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    name = "John"
    age = 23
    if name == "John" and age == 23:
        print("Your name is John, and you are also 23 years old.")
    
    if name == "John" or name == "Rick":
        print("Your name is either John or Rick.")
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>The "in" operator</h3>

                <p>
                    The "in" operator could be used to check if a specified object exists within an iterable object container, such as a list:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    name = "John"
    if name in ["John", "Rick"]:
        print("Your name is either John or Rick.")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Python uses indentation to define code blocks, instead of brackets. The standard Python indentation is 4 spaces, although tabs and any other space size will work, as long as it is consistent. Notice that code blocks do not need any termination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here is an example for using Python's "if" statement using code blocks:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    statement = False
    another_statement = True
    if statement is True:
        # do something
        pass
    elif another_statement is True: # else if
        # do something else
        pass
    else:
        # do another thing
        pass
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    x = 2
    if x == 2:
        print("x equals two!")
    else:
        print("x does not equal to two.")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    A statement is evaulated as true if one of the following is correct: 1. The "True" boolean variable is given, or calculated using an expression, such as an arithmetic comparison. 2. An object which is not considered "empty" is passed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are some examples for objects which are considered as empty: 1. An empty string: "" 2. An empty list: [] 3. The number zero: 0 4. The false boolean variable: False
                </p>
            
            <h3>The 'is' operator</h3>

                <p>
                    Unlike the double equals operator "==", the "is" operator does not match the values of the variables, but the instances themselves. For example:
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    x = [1,2,3]
    y = [1,2,3]
    print(x == y) # Prints out True
    print(x is y) # Prints out False
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>The "not" operator</h3>

                <p>
                    Using "not" before a boolean expression inverts it:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    print(not False) # Prints out True
    print((not False) == (False)) # Prints out False
                    </code>
                </pre>
        </section>

            <header class=header-section>
                <h2>Loops</h2>
            </header>

                <p>
                    There are two types of loops in Python, for and while.
                </p>
            
            <h3>The "for" loop</h3>

                <p>
                    For loops iterate over a given sequence. Here is an example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    primes = [2, 3, 5, 7]
    for prime in primes:
        print(prime)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    For loops can iterate over a sequence of numbers using the "range" and "xrange" functions. The difference between range and xrange is that the range function returns a new list with numbers of that specified range, whereas xrange returns an iterator, which is more efficient. (Python 3 uses the range function, which acts like xrange). Note that the range function is zero based.
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # Prints out the numbers 0,1,2,3,4
    for x in range(5):
        print(x)
    
    # Prints out 3,4,5
    for x in range(3, 6):
        print(x)
    
    # Prints out 3,5,7
    for x in range(3, 8, 2):
        print(x)
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>"while" loops</h3>

                <p>
                    While loops repeat as long as a certain boolean condition is met. For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # Prints out 0,1,2,3,4

    count = 0
    while count < 5:
        print(count)
        count += 1  # This is the same as count = count + 1
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>"break" and "continue" statements</h3>

                <p>
                    <strong>break</strong> is used to exit a for loop or a while loop, whereas <strong>continue</strong> is used to skip the current block, and return to the "for" or "while" statement. A few examples:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # Prints out 0,1,2,3,4

    count = 0
    while True:
        print(count)
        count += 1
        if count >= 5:
            break
    
    # Prints out only odd numbers - 1,3,5,7,9
    for x in range(10):
        # Check if x is even
        if x % 2 == 0:
            continue
        print(x)
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>Can we use "else" clause for loops?</h3>
                <p>
                    Unlike languages like C,CPP.. we can use else for loops. When the loop condition of "for" or "while" statement fails then code part in "else" is executed. If a break statement is executed inside the for loop then the "else" part is skipped. Note that the "else" part is executed even if there is a continue statement.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # Prints out 0,1,2,3,4 and then it prints "count value reached 5"

    count=0
    while(count<5):
        print(count)
        count +=1
    else:
        print("count value reached %d" %(count))
    
    # Prints out 1,2,3,4
    for i in range(1, 10):
        if(i%5==0):
            break
        print(i)
    else:
        print("this is not printed because for loop is terminated because of break but not due to fail in condition")
                    </code>

                <h2>Functions</h2>
            </header>

            <h3>What are Functions?</h3>

                <p>
                    Functions are a convenient way to divide your code into useful blocks, allowing us to order our code, make it more readable, reuse it and save some time. Also functions are a key way to define interfaces so programmers can share their code.
                </p>
            
            <h3>How do you write functions in Python?</h3>

                <p>
                    As we have seen on previous tutorials, Python makes use of blocks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A block is a area of code of written in the format of:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    block_head:
        1st block line
        2nd block line
        ...
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Where a block line is more Python code (even another block), and the block head is of the following format: block_keyword block_name(argument1,argument2, ...) Block keywords you already know are "if", "for", and "while".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Functions in python are defined using the block keyword "def", followed with the function's name as the block's name. For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    def my_function():
        print("Hello From My Function!")
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Functions may also receive arguments (variables passed from the caller to the function). For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
        print("Hello, %s , From My Function!, I wish you %s"%(username, greeting))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Functions may return a value to the caller, using the keyword- 'return' . For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>How do you call functions in Python?</h3>

                <p>
                    Simply write the function's name followed by (), placing any required arguments within the brackets. For example, lets call the functions written above (in the previous example):
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # Define our 3 functions
    def my_function():
        print("Hello From My Function!")
    
    def my_function_with_args(username, greeting):
        print("Hello, %s, From My Function!, I wish you %s"%(username, greeting))
    
    def sum_two_numbers(a, b):
        return a + b
    
    # print(a simple greeting)
    my_function()
    
    #prints - "Hello, John Doe, From My Function!, I wish you a great year!"
    my_function_with_args("John Doe", "a great year!")
    
    # after this line x will hold the value 3!
    x = sum_two_numbers(1,2)
                    </code>
                </pre>
