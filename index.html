                <p>
                    Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax. It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code. The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive - it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different. This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the print statement. In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked with parentheses.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To print a string in Python 3, just write:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    print('Hello, world!')
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>Indentation</h3>
                <p>
                    Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    x = 1
    if x == 1:
        print('Hello, World!')
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>Variables and Types</h2>
            </header>
                <p>
                    Python is completely object oriented, and not "statically typed". You do not need to declare variables before using them, or declare their type. Every variable in Python is an object.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This tutorial will go over a few basic types of variables.
                </p>

            <h3>Numbers</h3>

                <p>
                    Python supports two types of numbers - integers(whole numbers) and floating point numbers(decimals). (It also supports complex numbers, which will not be explained in this tutorial).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To define an integer, use the following syntax:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    myint = 7
    print(myint)
                    </code>
                </pre>       
                
                <p>
                    To define a floating point number, you may use one of the following notations:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    myfloat = 7.0
    print(myfloat)
    myfloat = float(7)
    print(myfloat)
                    </code>
                </pre>    

            <h3>Strings</h3>
                <p>
                    Strings are defined either with a single quote or a double quotes.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mystring = 'hello'
    print(mystring)
    mystring = "hello"
    print(mystring)
                    </code>
                </pre>   
                
                <p>
                    The difference between the two is that using double quotes makes it easy to include apostrophes (whereas these would terminate the string if using single quotes)
                </p>
       
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mystring = "Don't worry about apostrophes"
    print(mystring)
                    </code>
                </pre>   

                <p>
                    There are additional variations on defining strings that make it easier to include things such as carriage returns, backslashes and Unicode characters. These are beyond the scope of this tutorial, but are covered in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings" target="_blank">Python documentation.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Simple operators can be executed on numbers and strings:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    one = 1
    two = 2
    three = one + two
    print(three)
    
    hello = "hello"
    world = "world"
    helloworld = hello + " " + world
    print(helloworld)
                    </code>
                </pre>  
                
                <p>
                    Assignments can be done on more than one variable "simultaneously" on the same line like this
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    a, b = 3, 4
    print(a,b)
                    </code>
                </pre>  

                <p>
                    Mixing operators between numbers and strings is not supported:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This will not work!
    one = 1
    two = 2
    hello = "hello"
    
    print(one + two + hell  o)
                    </code>
                </pre>  
        </section>

        <!--3-->
        <section class="main-section" id="Lists">
            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>Lists</h2>
            </header>

                <p>
                    Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.
                </p>
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mylist = []
    mylist.append(1)
    mylist.append(2)
    mylist.append(3)
    print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
    print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
    print(mylist[2]) # prints 3
    
    # prints out 1,2,3
    for x in mylist:
        print(x)
                    </code>
                </pre>   

                <p>
                    Accessing an index which does not exist generates an exception (an error).
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    print(mylist[10])
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <h2>Basic Operators</h2>
            </header>
                <p>
                    This section explains how to use basic operators in Python.
                </p>
            
            <h3>Arithmetic Operators</h3>
               
                <p>
                    Just as any other programming languages, the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators can be used with numbers.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    number = 1 + 2 * 3 / 4.0
    print(number)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Try to predict what the answer will be. Does python follow order of operations?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another operator available is the modulo (%) operator, which returns the integer remainder of the division. dividend % divisor = remainder.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    remainder = 11 % 3
    print(remainder)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Using two multiplication symbols makes a power relationship.
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    squared = 7 ** 2
    cubed = 2 ** 3
    print(squared)
    print(cubed)
                    </code>
                </pre>
            
            <h3>Using Operators with Strings</h3>

                <p>
                    Python supports concatenating strings using the addition operator:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    helloworld = "hello" + " " + "world"
    print(helloworld)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Python also supports multiplying strings to form a string with a repeating sequence:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    lotsofhellos = "hello" * 10
    print(lotsofhellos)
                    </code>
                </pre>

            <h3>Using Operators with Lists</h3>
                
                <p>
                    Lists can be joined with the addition operators:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    even_numbers = [2,4,6,8]
    odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7]
    all_numbers = odd_numbers + even_numbers
    print(all_numbers)
                    </code>
                </pre>
                
                <p>
                    Just as in strings, Python supports forming new lists with a repeating sequence using the multiplication operator:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    print([1,2,3] * 3)
                    </code>
                </pre>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="String_Formatting">
            <header class="header-section">
                <h2>String Formatting</h2>
            </header>

                <p>
                    Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This prints out "Hello, John!"
    name = "John"
    print("Hello, %s!" % name)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    To use two or more argument specifiers, use a tuple (parentheses):
                </p>
                
                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This prints out "John is 23 years old."
    name = "John"
    age = 23
    print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Any object which is not a string can be formatted using the %s operator as well. The string which returns from the "repr" method of that object is formatted as the string. For example:
                </p>

                <pre>
                    <code class="code-block">
    # This prints out: A list: [1, 2, 3]
    mylist = [1,2,3]
    print("A list: %s" % mylist)
                    </code>
                </pre>

                <p>
                    Here are some basic argument specifiers you should know:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        %s - String (or any object with a string representation, like numbers)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %d - Integers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %f - Floating point numbers
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %.<number of digits>f - Floating point numbers with a fixed amount of digits to the right of the dot.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        %x/%X - Integers in hex representation (lowercase/uppercase)
                    </li>
                </ul>
